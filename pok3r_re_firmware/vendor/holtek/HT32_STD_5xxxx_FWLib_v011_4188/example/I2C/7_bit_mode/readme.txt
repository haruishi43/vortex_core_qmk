@par Example Description:

This example describes how to configure I2C0 to I2C1 transmission in 7 bit mode.

Transmission behavior implies as following:

I2C0 is configured as Master transmitter and I2C1 is configured as Slave receiver.

I2C0 sends data to I2C1 one by one, next datum will be sent by I2C0 until I2C1 receives 
each datum completely, after 4 data are sent, I2C0 will generate a STOP and program will
compare the received data to the transferred data to check on data validation. 

@par Directory Contents:

- I2C/7_bit_mode/main.c               Main program
- I2C/7_bit_mode/ht32fxxxx_it.c       Interrupt handlers

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- Remember to connect I2C0 to I2C1 respectively. Refer "ht32_board_config.h" for pin assignment.
- This example shows the result by LED1 and LED2.
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
