@par Example Description:

This example describes how to enable security protection for HT32 FLASH.

If the security function has been enabled, the flash code and data can not be read by debug port. The only way
to disable the security function is mass erase.

Enable security function by calling FLASH_ProgramOptionByte() function with the struct member,
"MainSecurity=1". Generate a system reset to reload the new Option Byte value by NVIC_SystemReset() function.

The Flash code and data access is not allowed when the security protection is enabled and debug port access
occurred. It causes the program can not be executed when you download it into the Flash by the IDE via debug
adapter (debug port access). So that, you need apply a power-on reset to run the code. (power-off the board
and power-on again).
