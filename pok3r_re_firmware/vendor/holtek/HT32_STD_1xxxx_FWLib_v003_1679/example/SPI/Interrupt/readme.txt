 @endverbatim

@par Example Description:

This example describes how to configure SPI transmission by interrupt.

Transmission behavior implies as following:

This example configures SPI0 as master and SPI1 as slave, remember to set SEL as output mode for 
slave select and to enable TXBE & RXBNE interrupt for both SPIs, both SPIs are configured with 8 
bits mode, non-FIFO mode, HCLK/6 MHz transmission speed.

The transmission will start once the program enables SPI0, then it will generate interrupt by SPI0 
flag TXBE set, the program will determine whether TXBE or RXBNE set in ISR, if the interrupt is 
generated by TXBE set, SPI0 will send datum to SPI1 from SPI0_Buffer_Tx, otherwise if the interrupt
is generated by RXBNE set, SPI0 will receive datum to SPI0_Buffer_Rx from SPI1, this transmission 
will end after 4 data are sent and received by SPI0, The same behavior slave SPI1 does simultaneously.

- SPI/Interrupt/ht32f1xxxx_01_it.c     Interrupt handlers

@par Hardware and Software Environment:

- Remember to connect SPI0(PA4, PA5, PA6, PA7) to SPI1(PD14, PD15, PE0, PD13) respectively.
- This example shows the result by LED1 and LED2.
- This example can be run on HT32 Series development board.
